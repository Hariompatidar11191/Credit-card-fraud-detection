# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning. The project handles imbalanced data through undersampling, applies balanced training, and compares models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Performance is evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC metrics.


# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using an imbalanced dataset.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Techniques
- Undersampling for class balancing
- ROC-AUC evaluation
- Confusion matrix and classification report

## Output
Trained fraud detection model saved as `fraud_model.pkl`.



## Dataset
The dataset is too large to upload to GitHub.

Download it from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Place the file `creditcard.csv` in the project folder before running the notebook.
